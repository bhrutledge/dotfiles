dotfiles
========

Clone the repo wherever you like, then `cd` into it and run:

- `link.sh`: Create symbolic links in `$HOME` to `.*` files and directories

## TODO

- Better handling of subdirectories (i.e., don't necessarily want all files)
- Add mapping of repo paths to destination paths (e.g., for `~/Library` files)
