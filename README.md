dotfiles
========

Clone the repo wherever you like, then `cd` into it and run:

- `link.sh`: Create symbolic links in `$HOME` to `.*` files and directories
- `vim.sh`: Install/update Vim plugins

## TODO

- Better handling of subdirectories (i.e., don't necessarily want all files)
- Add mapping of repo paths to destination paths (e.g., for `~/Library` files)
- Add more install scripts (e.g., for `visual-studio-code/extensions.txt`)
